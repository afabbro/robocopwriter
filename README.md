# Robo-Cop Writer

Made from a Tinkerkit attached to an Arduino. Some LEDs, four servos converted into wheels with 3D printed bits wrapped in rubber for traction. An articulated arm with a pen is mounted on the back for doodle action. Chassis was made from a box and necessary items were hot-glued to it.

Hopefully will try and get some detailed photos up here showing teh bot in action so that you can copy the setup and build your own!
